# Network_Design
An application to network design the program generates a network topology, with capacities assigned to the links, according to the studied model, using the shortest path based fast solution method. The program also computes the total cost of the designed network.

Algorithm used - Floyd Warshall 

Objective and Outputs in the Report
• How does the total cost of the network depends on k?
• How does the density of the obtained network depends on k? Here the density is defined as the number of directed edges that are assigned nonzero capacity, divided by the total possible number of directed edges, which is N(N − 1).
• Show some of the obtained network topologies graphically. Specifically, draw three of them: one with k = 3, one with k = 8, and one with k = 13.
